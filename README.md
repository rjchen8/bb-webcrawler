# bb-webcrawler

This is a webcrawler which checks the availability of a BestBuy product and sends an email if the program is run while the product is in stock.

In order for this program to work, one must use OAuth 2.0 to enable the Gmail API using their own credentials. Otherwise, EZgmail will not function as expected and this program will not work.
